          I'm in the BAS Software Development program at BC. I've recently
          started learning software engineering, and love it! I love all the
          possibilities you given and how you have to mix logic and creativity.
          I'm excited to learn more advanced web development, which is essential
          in the modern day.

          In my freetime I like to play piano, learn languages, read books and
          articles, and cook! I also love playing with my two multipoo dogs.
